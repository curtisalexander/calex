This is the personal website and blog of Curtis Alexander.

In time I hope to develop a regular writing, and thus posting, habit.  The content on the site will be something I wish to share and I hope others will benefit from.  It may even develop a particular audience and niche if I am so lucky.

But more importantly I am interested in what happens to one who writes regularly.  What would be the personal benefit &mdash; most notably in one's thinking patterns &mdash; of regularly writing for a period of weeks, months, and even years?

Finally, I would identify myself as an [obliger](https://gretchenrubin.com/2017/05/get-something-done-accountability/) and thus am attempting to hold myself accountable by stating my intended efforts publicly.
