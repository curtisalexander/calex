<p>This is the personal website and blog of Curtis Alexander.</p>
<p>In time I hope to develop a regular writing, and thus posting, habit. The content on the site will be something I wish to share and I hope others will benefit from. It may even develop a particular audience and niche if I am so lucky.</p>
<p>But more importantly I am interested in what happens to one who writes regularly. What would be the personal benefit — most notably in one’s thinking patterns — of regularly writing for a period of weeks, months, and even years?</p>
<p>Finally, I would identify myself as an <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/2017/05/get-something-done-accountability/">obliger</a> and thus am attempting to hold myself accountable by stating my intended efforts publicly.</p>
