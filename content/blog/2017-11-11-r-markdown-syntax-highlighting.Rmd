## Prior art

In the [past](http://curtisalexander.github.io/rmarkdown-syntax-highlighting/) I had explored using the [highr](https://github.com/yihui/highr) package to enable syntax highlighting of languages that were not supported within [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).  I never loved the solution as it required one to download and setup [highlight](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/install.php).  In addition, the solution also required some manual steps to be run from the command line to include the appropriate css file as well.


## What is the problem again?
Repeating my original problem &mdash; I want to have syntax highlighting for [SAS](https://www.sas.com/) code within my R Markdown documents.

R Markdown relies on [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) for its syntax highlighting.  Specifically, the [skylighting](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/) Haskell library is utilized by `pandoc` for its highlighting.  The list of languages that are supported can be found [here](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/tree/master/xml).

RStudio [provides](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html) the nice illustration above describing how one begins with an R Markdown document and ends with an html document.  `pandoc` is what ultimately performs sytnax highlighting using the aforementioned `skylighting` library.


## The answer...[CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
Rather than relying on `pandoc`, I determined a way to take advantage of the Javascript text editor [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) when producing html documents.  Again, CodeMirror is a Javascript text editor that I simply set to be read only which serves as a form of syntax highlighting.

> **Aside**: In the end the answer always seems to be Javascript.  For many [reasons](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f), I have avoided learning Javascript.  But for my use case here, I must admit that Javascript is quite helpful!


## R Markdown Example
To go straight to an example, take a look at either the [R Markdown document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curtisalexander/rmarkdown-with-alt-langs/master/rmarkdown-with-alt-langs.Rmd) or the [rendered html](https://curtisalexander.github.io/rmarkdown-with-alt-langs/).  This [repo](https://github.com/curtisalexander/rmarkdown-with-alt-langs/) will be utilized throughout as an example.

## R Markdown Setup
There are quite a few steps required but once they are all stitched together, they allow for SAS (and other language) syntax highlighting that wasn't possible before.

### Requirements
The following R packages are required for the proposed solution.

* [stringr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html)
* [htmltools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmltools/)

In addition, one will need access to the internet as the solution makes use of `<script>` tags to read in Javascript libraries from a [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/).

### Code Mirror Javascript/CSS
There is a stylesheet and Javascript files provided by CodeMirror that need to be included.  My preference is to create a `header.html` file and then make sure it is included within my `YAML` header.

Below is an example of the YAML header for [rmarkdown-with-alt-langs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curtisalexander/rmarkdown-with-alt-langs/master/rmarkdown-with-alt-langs.Rmd).  Specifically take note of the `in_header` key.

```YAML
title: "R Markdown with Alternate Languages"
author: "Curtis Alexander"
output:
  html_document:
    include:
      in_header: header.html
    mathjax: null
params:
  hilang:
    - sas
    - crystal
```

The file [header.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curtisalexander/rmarkdown-with-alt-langs/master/header.html) contains the following.  Note that I used links to a CDN rather than directly pointing to CodeMirror.

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/codemirror/5.31.0/codemirror.min.css">
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/codemirror/5.31.0/codemirror.min.js"></script>
<style>
  .CodeMirror {
    border: 1px solid #eee;
    height: auto;
  }
</style>
```

### [R Markdown Parameter](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html)
Within the `yaml` block above, the language(s) to be used for highlighting within the document is/are set with the `hilang` option.  For a full list of all languages that can be utilized, take a look at the CodeMirror [languages page](http://codemirror.net/mode/index.html).

### `_hilang_setup.Rmd`
Next, one needs to create a [knitr source hook](https://yihui.name/knitr/hooks/) in order to wrap up the SAS code in `<textarea>` tags.  The file [_hilang_setup.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curtisalexander/rmarkdown-with-alt-langs/master/_hilang_setup.Rmd) contains two R code chunks, including the actual source hook.

The first R code chunk pulls in the needed Javascript from CodeMirror for the languages set within the `yaml` block.  Note that this block requires the `asis` option to be set.

```R
# take a character vector of parameters and inject
#   the appropriate script tag for code mirror
# ensures that the script tags are only inserted once
for(i in seq_along(params$hilang)) {
  js_mode <- paste0("\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/codemirror/5.31.0/mode/", tolower(params$hilang[i]), "/", tolower(params$hilang[i]), ".min.js\"></script>\n")
  cat(htmltools::htmlPreserve(js_mode))
}
```


The second R code chunk sets the actual source hook.

```R
knitr::knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options) {
  if (!is.null(options$hilang)) {
    textarea_id <- paste(sample(LETTERS, 5), collapse = "")
    code_open <- paste0("\n\n<textarea id=\"", textarea_id, "\">\n")
    code_close <- "\n</textarea>"
    jscript_editor <- paste0("\n<script> var codeElement = document.getElementById(\"", textarea_id, "\"); var editor = null; if (null != codeElement) { editor = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(codeElement, { lineNumbers: true, readOnly: true, viewportMargin: Infinity, mode: 'text/x-", tolower(options$hilang), "' }); } </script>\n")

    # if the option from_file is set to true then assume that
    #   whatever is in the code chunk is a file path
    if (!is.null(options$from_file) && options$from_file) {
      code_body <- readLines(file.path(x))
    } else {
      code_body <- x
    }

    knitr::asis_output(
      htmltools::htmlPreserve(
        stringr::str_c(
          code_open,
          paste(code_body, collapse = "\n"),
          code_close,
          jscript_editor
        )
      )
    )
  } else {
    stringr::str_c("\n\n```", tolower(options$engine), "\n", paste(x, collapse = "\n", "\n```\n\n"))
  }
})
```

The source hook doesn't have to be in a separate file.  However, I like to include in a separate file so that within my relevant R Markdown document, I just need to include the following to bring it into scope within the document.

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode">```{r, child="_hilang_setup.Rmd"}
```</code></pre></div>


### SAS Code
Next is the easy part &mdash; just drop the SAS code into an R Markdown code chunk.  A code chunk needs the following options to be set &mdash; `eval=FALSE` and `hilang="sas"`.  Below is a simple example.

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode">```{r, eval=FALSE, hilang="sas"}
data _null_;
  x = 1;
  put x=;
run;
```</code></pre></div>

The source hook just established identifes the SAS code within `<textarea>` tags and then applys CodeMirror's Javascript to the entire block of text within the `<textarea>` tag.

## Full Example

A full example follows &mdash; assuming one makes use of `header.html` and `_hilang_setup.Rmd`.

## Future Work
In the future, I would like to consider:

* Creating my own [custom output format](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_custom_formats.html)
* Creating an actual package with everything bound up that can be conveniently installed
* See if I can further parameterize the [configuration options](http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#config) that are passed to the `CodeMirror.fromTextArea` Javascript function.
