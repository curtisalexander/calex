Below is my general workflow for creating a blog post using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

1. Open my project file &mdash; `open calex.Rproj`.
2. Utilize the `Tools -> Addins` to select the `New Post` addin from the `blogdown` package.  Note that I have updated my global Rprofile &mdash; `~/.Rprofile` &mdash; to include the following:

```
options(servr.daemon = TRUE,
        blogdown.author = "Curtis Alexander",
        blogdown.subdir = "blog")
```

3. Below is a screenshot of the completed `New Post` addin form for this particular blog post.

4. **[Optional]** In order to preview locally, utilize `Tools -> Addins` and the `Serve Site` addin from the `blogdown` package.  It will run `blogdown::serve_site()`.
5. Write up my post using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) flavored markdown and using [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) as my IDE.
6. **[Optional]** Cleanup output artifacts using the `Build -> More` button to run `Clean All`.  This in turn executes the command `rmarkdown::clean_site()` which removes the directories `blogdown`, `public`, and `static/rmarkdown-libs`.
7. Next I utilize the `Build Website` button within RStudio.  If I am already serving the site and taking advantage of the `servr` daemon in step 4, then this step is unneeded.
8. As recommended at the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html) site, I restart my R session and run the command `blogdown::hugo_build()` within the R console.
9. I then go to the `Git` menu within RStudio and commit and push my changes.  I push everything to a repo within Github.
10. [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) then picks up the changes to the `master` branch of the Github repo that houses my website.  The final [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) command that builds the website is run by netlify.  After building, the static site is uploaded to netlify's CDN.
11. et voil&agrave;!
