Below is my general workflow for creating a blog post using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

1. Open my project file &mdash; `open ../calex.Rproj`.
2. Utilize the `Tools -> Addins` to select the `New Post` addin from the `blogdown` package.  Note that I have updated my global Rprofile &mdash; `~/.Rprofile` &mdash; to include the following:

```
options(servr.daemon = TRUE,
        blogdown.author = "Curtis Alexander",
        blogdown.subdir = "blog")
```

3. Below is a screenshot of the completed `New Post` addin form for this particular blog post.

4. Write up my post using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) flavored markdown and using [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) as my IDE.
5. [Optional] I utilize the `Build->More` button to run `Clean All`.  This in turn executes the command `rmarkdown::clean_site()` which removes the directories `blogdown`, `public`, and `static/rmarkdown-libs`.
6. I do not use the `Build Website` button within RStudio.  Instead, I manually run the command `blogdown::hugo_build()` within the R console.
7. I then go to the `Git` menu within RStudio and commit and push my changes.
8. [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) then picks up the changes to the `master` branch of the Github repo that houses my website and completes the website build and uploads to their CDN.
9. et voil&agrave;!
