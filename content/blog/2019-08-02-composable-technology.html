<p>At the moment I am seated outside connected over Wi-Fi with an iPhone. I am using my microphone and the native speech recognition capabilities to compose this draft. After I am finished composing this message, I will push this locally composed document using <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> up to <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a>. And then I will let <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/">Azure Pipelines</a> take over and actually build and deploy this post.</p>
<p>In the future I see this more easily used with the <a href="https://www.calex.org/til/">today I learned</a> section of my site. I can work on small documents and push whenever I have a thought and am away from my laptop.</p>
<p>Ultimately this post is not instructive in any way. Instead, I marvel at how technology can be composed in interesting ways to enable functionality we would struggle to imagine just a few years prior.</p>
