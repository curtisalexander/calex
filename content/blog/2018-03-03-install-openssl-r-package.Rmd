Due to the various `openssl` libraries I have throughout my system (Apple's version, homebrew's version, miniconda3's version), I was having trouble installing the [openssl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=openssl) R package.

Below is a shell script that makes use of my [cran-dl](https://github.com/curtisalexander/cran-dl) script to first download the needed `tar.gz` file for `openssl` and then install it from the command line with `R CMD INSTALL` and the appropriate settings for `--configure-vars`.

The below is also available in [gist](https://gist.github.com/curtisalexander/7dd6ddff900c2a7aa4461b34aa4dbde8) form.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

# where to begin?
DIR="${HOME}/code"
cd "${DIR}"

echo
echo "Working from within ${PWD}"
echo

# clone cran-dl repo
if [ ! -d "cran-dl" ] ; then
    printf "Would you like to clone cran-dl? [y/N]: "
    if read -q; then
        echo; git clone https://github.com/curtisalexander/cran-dl; echo
    fi
fi


echo "Note that cran-dl requires the following R packages be installed:"
echo "  - docopt"
echo "  - httr"
echo "  - purrr"
echo "  - rvest"
echo "  - xml2"
echo
echo "To install within R, execute the following:"
echo "  - install.packages(c(\"docopt\", \"httr\", \"purrr\", \"rvest\", \"xml2\"))"

# create the directory if it does not exist
if [ ! -d "r-pkgs" ] ; then
    echo
    echo "Making the directory r-pkgs"
    mkdir -p "${DIR}/r-pkgs"
fi

# from the command line, download the tar.gz file
echo
echo "Download the package using cran-dl"
${DIR}/cran-dl/cran-dl --pkg=openssl --path="${DIR}/r-pkgs"
echo

# get the current openssl version
echo
echo "Get the current version of openssl"
OPENSSL_VER="$(openssl version | cut -d' ' -f 2)"
echo "  - ${OPENSSL_VER}"

# install using appropriate configuration
OPENSSL_R_VER="$(ls -1 ${DIR}/r-pkgs | grep ^openssl | sort -R | head -1)"
echo
echo "Installing...${OPENSSL_R_VER}"
echo

sudo R CMD INSTALL -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include LIB_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib' "${DIR}/r-pkgs/${OPENSSL_R_VER}"
```
