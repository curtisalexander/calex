<p>Today I figured out how to utilize <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> + <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> + <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> to publish this blog. It obviously depends on the amazing work by Yihui Xie on <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>.</p>
<p>I plan to document this in greater detail in the future but wanted to out least stub out my approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I wanted to have my <code>master</code> branch only contain the needed static files and <code>Rmd</code> files to produce my blog.</li>
<li>I then take advantage of Travis and use it to render the <code>html</code> files from <code>Rmd</code> files using <code>blogdown::build_site()</code>. Specifically, I don’t utilize Hugo to build my files.</li>
<li>Next, I utilize a <a href="https://github.com/curtisalexander/calex/blob/master/publish.sh">simple script</a> to commit the just built <code>html</code> files to the <code>publish</code> branch.</li>
<li>The <code>publish</code> branch gets pushed back to Github.</li>
<li>Netlify is setup to look for changes on the <code>publish</code> branch rather than the <code>master</code> branch. Netlify then utilizes Hugo to finish building and deploying my site.</li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer this solution as it allows me to continue to utilize Netlify for publishing. I <a href="https://yihui.name/en/2017/06/netlify-instead-of-github-pages/">agree with Yihui</a> that Netlify is a fantastic service and prefer using it over Github Pages. However, I was previously building all of my files — going from <code>Rmd</code> to <code>html</code> — on my local machine. I wanted the ability to utilize my phone or web browser to author a post and take advantage of all the various automation and CI tools to publish to the web.</p>
<p>Now when I want to write something, I usually start with copying a <a href="https://github.com/curtisalexander/calex/blob/master/content/blog/1970-01-01-template.Rmd">template</a> file, adding my thoughts, removing <code>draft</code> from the YAML front matter, and then committing to <code>master</code>.</p>
<p>As an example I added this sentence via my phone. I have the beautiful <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> app on my phone which I can use to manage git repos. Alternatively I could just use the Github site from my phone or any web browser.</p>
