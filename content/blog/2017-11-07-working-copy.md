While using the [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) app for iOS, I simply want to test out if I can 

* Use the app on my phone 
* Push the changes to Github
* Have the build system at [netlify](https://www.netlify.com) run [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) over my md files and republish my website

Assuming the test works that means I can just use my phone for really simple posts using plain Markdown (as opposed to using RMarkdown as a preprocessor and a development environment).
