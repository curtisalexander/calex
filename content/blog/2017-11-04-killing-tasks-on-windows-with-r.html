<p>On my Windows machine, I oftentimes want to kill a set of applications that are running. This is especially true when I don’t have full control of my machine and am unable to adjust the applications that launch on startup.</p>
<p>Below are two examples — both accomplish the same feat — that use R to call down to the OS and kill a list of tasks / applications. One example is more <a href="#taskkill-readable-annotated">readable</a> while the <a href="#taskkill-terse-single-pipeline">other</a> is more terse. An alternative impetus for writing the short scripts below was to experiment with the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/processx">processx</a> package. A more portable way to accomplish would be to simply use Powershell. But this was a fun exercise.</p>
