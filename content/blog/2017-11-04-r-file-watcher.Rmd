While working on articles within this blog, I can utilize `blogdown::serve_site()` which in turn calls `servr::httw()`.  This will serve my site locally and trigger a rebuild whenever a file is saved.  However, this doesn't work for an [RMarkdown website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).  Instead, I utilized the function `watch` from the `testthat` package to watch my repository directory for changes and rebuild my website with a call to `rmarkdown::render_site()`.

The script example below makes use of [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.R) in order to create a script that one can simply run from the command line.
