The [macOS keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keychain-access/kyca1083/mac) may be queried from the command line.  This is useful for scripting - for instance, it is useful for pulling back a personal access token for Github stored in the keychain.

```sh
sudo security find-internet-password -gws github.com
```

where

```
-g ==> Display the password for the item found
-s ==> Match "server" string
-w ==> Display only the password on stdout
```

To get help:

```sh
# overall help
sudo security -h 

# subcommand help
sudo security find-internet-password -h
```

<br/>

To list keychains:

```sh
sudo security list-keychains
```

<br/>

To list items in a keychain:

sudo security find-internet-password
```
