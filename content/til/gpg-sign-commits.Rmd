Instructions for signing commits via git and [Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification) requires one to first setup a [gpg](https://gnupg.org/) key.  To utilize the [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) algorithm, create your key like so.

```
gpg --quick-generate-key "FirstName LastName <username@somerandomemaildomain.com>" future-default default none
```

If one would like to add a comment, then just include in parentheses.

```
gpg --quick-generate-key "FirstName LastName (some comment) <username@somerandomemaildomain.com>" future-default default none
```

This is inspired by the shell script [gpgit](https://github.com/NicoHood/gpgit).
