The [macOS keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keychain-access/kyca1083/mac) may be queried from the command line.  This is useful for scripting - for instance, it is useful for pulling back a personal access token for Github stored in the keychain.

```
sudo security find-internet-password -gws github.com
```

where

`-g` ==> Display the password for the item found
`-s` ==> Match "server" string
`-w` ==> Display only the password on stdout
