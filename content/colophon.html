<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo theme</a> in use is <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme/">cocoa enhanced</a>.</p>
<p>I made one slight change to the theme in order to better space the image logo against headers. Within <code>themes/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme/layouts/partials/css/main.css</code>, I make the following update.</p>
<pre class="css"><code>div.header .container .logo {
  max-width: 100px;
  margin-left: -2em;
  /* Added to better space image logo against headers */
  padding-right: 5px;
}</code></pre>
